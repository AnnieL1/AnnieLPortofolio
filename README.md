## Submission criteria ##
    Your task is to create a portfolio site to showcase your work. Creators often have some kind of portfolio to show off what they can do, as developers, we are no exception. Your portfolio site should represent you, so while we have listed the requirements for it below, it should still have your own personal style all over it.
    
    Webpage requirements:
        1. Include at least one profile picture.
        2. Include biography (at least 100 words).
        3. Include a functional contact form.
        4. Have a section dedicated to listing projects you have worked on (there are many projects to add throughout this course!).
        5. Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
        6. Have at least 2 web pages.
        7. Be deployed on GitHub pages.
        8. Implements responsive design principles.
        9. Uses semantic HTML.
        
    Webpage bonuses:
        1. Have different styles for active, hover and focus states.
        2. Use JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site.
        
    Submission requirements:
        1. Link to your website.
        2. Document containing a link to your repository.
        3. Create a "screenshots" folder in the repository, containing screenshots that show:
              i. The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
              ii. The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.
