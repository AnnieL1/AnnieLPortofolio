                    Hi, I'm Annie. I'm currently completing the She Codes Plus bootcamp and learning to code. I hope to eventually transition into a career in programming and software development. I currently work in the business side of tech, with experience ranging from product ideation to requirements elicitation to project management. Having worked in teams with software engineers for over 5 years, I have decided that they do the fun work, and it is what I want to do! I want to use logical problem solving to build and maintain code, and have the satisfaction of seeing a program that I have helped build run smoothly!
                    <br> <br>
                    Outside of work and learning to code, I take every opportunity I can to get away from a computer screen. You will most likely find me playing board games, bouldering, or out in nature. Lisboa is one of the greatest boardgames ever created, and I will never say no to playing a round of Lisboa. It is based on the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, and the goal of the game is to rebuild Lisbon by trading goods and building infrastructure. Likewise, bouldering is a great sport, and I will always be down for a good climb. While you're climbing, you have to work out the next move to reach the top, and this distracts you from thinking about how much your hands and shoulders hurt. Bouldering is awesome because you don't realise you have been exercising until you finish the climbing session! Finally, when I'm after a relaxing day, I will be out in nature either at a beach or on a hike. Nothing beats a good walk and swim!
